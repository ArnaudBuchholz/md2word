The styles are distinguished by font and paragraph styles.
A font style is only assigned to a single word within a paragraph
(e.g., “<b>Bold</b>,” “<i>Italic</i>,” or “<samp>Programming Element</samp>”),
while a paragraph style is assigned to an entire paragraph
(e.g., "Normal" or "Bullet List").<br>
