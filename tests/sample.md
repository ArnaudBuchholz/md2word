> Example of heading styles

> NOTE
>> This is how a note is created

## Text styles

The styles are distinguished by font and paragraph styles. A font style is only assigned to a single word within a paragraph (e.g., “**Bold**,” “*Italic*,” or “`Programming Element`”), while a paragraph style is assigned to an entire paragraph (e.g., "Normal" or "Bullet List").

```text
**Bold**
*Italic*
`Programming Element`
```

### Paragraph Styles
No good, entertaining publication will only consist of standard paragraphs like this one. To present your content and to make your E-Bite look more interesting, you want to use lists, tables, boxes, code listings, and more.

### Lists
All lists are created from the styles under the Lists button in the Rheinwerk Publishing tab.
Your first option is the bullet list. Bullet lists are used for listing items that come in no particular order.

* Bullet lists are created via the Bullet List style.

A second paragraph within a bulleted list is indented and gets its own style assigned to it: Bullet List Indent. If a bullet list item is accompanied by a Bullet List Indent style, the main bulleted item should appear in bold (as it is above).

```
Listing code within bulleted lists should be tagged with the Bullet List Listing style in the Listing section.
```
 A listing with more than five lines of code should have a Listing Caption. Position the cursor in the last line of your code listing and click Listing Caption in the Insert/Indexing section.
